    "title": "Is your morning coffee really an energy boost or just a placebo?",
    "description": "Researchers compared the neurological effects of coffee and caffeine consumption.They found that coffee, but not caffeine consumption increases brain activity linked to visual processing and higher-level cognitive function.The findings mean that some key benefits of drinking coffee may not be related to caffeine."

    "title": "Regular naps might help keep brain younger by as much as 6.5 years",
    "description": "People with a genetic disposition for taking naps have a larger brain volume than others, according to new research.With brain volume often decreasing with age, the study shows that people with this genetic predisposition exhibit fewer years of brain aging than non-nappers.Whether the study reveals a causal connection between napping and brain health remains unclear, but it nonetheless offers a new exploration angle."

    "title": "Once-weekly insulin vs. daily injection: Study finds one is more effective than the other",
    "description": "Researchers conducted a Phase 3 trial among people with type 2 diabetes, comparing the efficacy and safety of a once-weekly insulin called “icodec” with the standard once-daily injection degludec. Degludec is a long-acting insulin drug that helps regulate blood sugar levels.They found that once-weekly icodec treatment resulted in greater reductions in blood sugar levels than once-daily degludec after 26 weeks."

    "title": "Could eating at night improve running endurance?",
    "description": "Studies in mice and humans have shown that limiting food intake to the active cycle — when an individual is most active and alert — has various health benefits, including weight loss and improved blood sugar control.Now, a new mouse study has shown that restricting feeding to the resting period greatly improved endurance in running tests.This effect was surprising and unexpected, as feeding during the resting period is typically considered to be detrimental to health."

    "title": "Intermittent fasting and traditional calorie counting about equal for weight loss",
    "description": "In a new study, researchers say intermittent fasting and calorie counting were both effective in helping people lose weight.They added that fasting did seem to produce better results for insulin sensitivity.Experts say diets affect each person differently, so it’s important to figure out which method works best for you."
